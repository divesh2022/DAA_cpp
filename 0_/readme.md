## 0/1 Knapsack Problem Solver

This Python script provides a solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic problem in computer science where you need to maximize the total value of items that can be placed in a knapsack of a given capacity.

### How it Works

The script defines a function `knapsack(values, weights, capacity)` that takes the following parameters:
- `values`: A list of integers representing the values of the items.
- `weights`: A list of integers representing the weights of the items.
- `capacity`: An integer representing the maximum capacity of the knapsack.

The function returns the maximum value that can be accommodated in the knapsack and a list of the selected items.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

The solution uses a dynamic programming table (`dp`) where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the first `i` items and a knapsack capacity of `w`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - A 2D list `dp` is initialized with zeros.
   - The initial state of the `dp` table is printed.

2. **Filling the Table**:
   - For each item, the table is filled based on whether the item is included in the knapsack or not.
   - The final state of the `dp` table is printed.

3. **Backtracking**:
   - To find the items included in the knapsack, the script backtracks through the `dp` table.
   - The selected items are added to a list.

### Example

The script includes an example with predefined values, weights, and capacity:

- `values = [60, 100, 120]`
- `weights = [1, 2, 3]`
- `capacity = 5`

### Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python 1knapsack.py
```

### Output

The script will output the dynamic programming table, the maximum value that can be accommodated in the knapsack, and the items included in the knapsack.

Example output:

```
Dynamic Programming Table:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60]
[0, 60, 100, 160, 160, 160]
[0, 60, 100, 160, 180, 220]

Maximum value that can be accommodated in the knapsack: 220

Items included in the knapsack:
Value: 120, Weight: 3
Value: 100, Weight: 2
```
